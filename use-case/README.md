This folder contains different use cases, their description, references, and other context.

Goal:

- Relating best practices to real world use cases.
- Discussion of core features and functionality from use cases and their NFs.
- Examination of existing use cases to discussion of kubenative implementations which provide the core features and functionality.

## How to add a new use case

If you just have an idea for a use case feel free to add to the discussion topic [listing networking uses cases](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg/discussions/39)

If you have a new use case you would like to discuss, create a new [github discussion topic](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg/discussions) with the details you have including attachements and/or links to any external content (eg. Google docs, hackmd, diagrams).

If you have enough content to writeup a full use case then feel free to create a pull request in this [use case folder](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg/tree/master/use-case) with either a
- single markdown file with all content included (including in-line diagrams) for the use case
- new use case folder with all content with a README.md as the starting point describing the use case
