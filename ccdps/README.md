# CNF Conformance Definition Proposal (CCDP)
A  CNF Conformance Definition Proposal (CCDP) is a way to propose, communicate and coordinate on new best practice definitions for the CNF Conformance program. You can read the full details of the project in [CCDP-1](0001-cnf-conformance-definition-proposal-process.md)

This process is still in a alpha state and feedback is welcome.

## Quick start for the CCDP process

Socialize an idea with the CNF WG. You can send your idea to the mailing list, or add it to the agenda for one of the upcoming meetings. Make sure that others think the work is worth taking up and will help review the CCDP and any code changes required.

Follow the process outlined in the [CCDP process document](0001-cnf-conformance-definition-proposal-process.md) and use the [CCDP template](NNNN-ccdp-template.md) to create a new proposal. Submit a pull request to add the proposal to the repo.

## CNF Use Cases

CCDP shall always refer to at least one of CNF WG use cases. Those use cases serve as the practical and concrete basis for deriving, discussing and evaluating the best practices for CNFs. Their value is in providing context and sanity check for CCDPs. With help of use cases we making sure that CCDPs are addressing specific problem or need from the real world. Please use [Use Case Template](../use-case/NNNN-UC-template.md) to contribute an use case.
