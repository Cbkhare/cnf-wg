## **Summary**

A standardized development process for CNF Conformance Definitions is proposed, in order to:



*   provide a common structure for proposing Conformance Definitions
*   ensure that the motivation for a Definition is clear
*   allow for the enumeration of testing milestones and graduation criteria
*   persist project information in a Version Control System (VCS) for future generations
*   support the creation of _high-value, user-facing_ information such as:
    *   an overall roadmap
    *   motivation for impactful changes
*   reserve GitHub issues for tracking work in flight, instead of creating "umbrella" issues
*   ensure community participants can successfully drive changes to completion while stakeholders are adequately represented throughout the process

This process is supported by a unit of work called a CNF Conformance Definition Proposal, or CCDP.

## **Motivation**

In a blog post describing the [road to Go 2](https://blog.golang.org/toward-go2), Russ Cox explains:

“that it is difficult but essential to describe the significance of a problem in a way that someone working in a different environment can understand”

Without a standardized mechanism for describing important Cloud Native best practices and principles, the wider telco community could struggle to weave a coherent narrative explaining why a particular CNF Definition is important. Additionally, users running critical infrastructure on Kubernetes need a forward-looking roadmap in order to plan their adoption strategies.

The purpose of the CCDP process is to reduce the amount of "tribal knowledge" in our community. By moving decisions from a smattering of mailing lists, video calls, and hallway conversations into a well tracked artifact, this process aims to enhance communication and discoverability.

An important goal of the CCDP process is ensuring that the process for submitting the content is both clear and efficient. The CCDP process is intended to create high-quality, uniform design documents for the CNF WG to deliberate.

### **Goals**

Providing a standardized way for the community to propose and discuss Cloud Native Definitions

### **Non-Goals**

Being an unchangeable template that does not meet the current needs of the community

## **Proposal**

The definition of what constitutes a Cloud Native best practice or principle is a foundational concern for the CNF WG. If a definition would be described in either written or verbal communication to anyone besides the author or developer, then consider creating a CCDP. The exact size and scale of an average CCDP will be determined as the group begins its work.

**CCDP Template**

The template for a CCDP is defined [here](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg/blob/requirements-to-best-practices/ccdps/NNNN-ccdp-template.md).

 **Important Metrics**

It is proposed that the primary metrics that would signal the success or failure of the CCDP process are:

*   how many "cloud native best practices and principles" are tracked with a CCDP
*   CCDP rejection rate
*   PRs referencing a CCDP merged per month
*   number of issues open which reference a CCDP
*   number of contributors who authored a CCDP
*   number of contributors who authored a CCDP for the first time

### **User Stories (Optional)**
#### **Story 1**
I want to propose a new Cloud Native best practice definition. I will fill out the create a PR in the CCDP folder to start the discussion around the Cloud Native Definition. With the template, I will be able to articulate my ideas to the community.

#### **Story 2**
I agree/disagree with a proposed Cloud Native best practice definition. After reading through the CCDP, I will be able to comment on the PR and contribute to the discussion around it.

### **Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)**

This first structure is still WIP and should not be considered final. As the CNF WG begins to dive into their work, this format and process should be modified to meet the WG’s current needs.


### **References**

The CCDP process, as proposed, was essentially copied from Kubernetes KEP which are similar to the [Rust RFC process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) which itself resembles the [Python PEP process](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/).

### **Drawbacks/Alternatives**

Any process has the potential to engender resentment within the community or not fits its needs. There is a risk that the CCDP process as designed will need to be changed or retired completely.

The centrality of Git and GitHub within the CCDP process also may place too high a barrier to potential contributors. However, given that both Git and GitHub are required to contribute code changes to many projects today, perhaps it would be reasonable to invest in providing support to those unfamiliar with this tooling.


**GitHub Issues vs. CCDPs**

The use of GitHub issues when proposing changes does not provide the CNF WG good facilities for signaling approval or rejection of a proposed change because anyone can open a GitHub issue at any time. 

In addition to the challenge of managing issues over time, searching for text within an issue can be challenging. The flat hierarchy of issues can also make navigation and categorization tricky. Not all community members will be uncomfortable using Git directly, but it is imperative for our community to educate people on a standard set of tools so they can take their experience to other projects they may decide to work on in the future. While git is a fantastic version control system (VCS), it is neither a project management tool nor a cogent way of managing a backlog. This proposal is limited to motivating the creation of a standardized definition of work in order to facilitate project management. This primitive for describing a unit of work may also allow contributors to create their own personalized view of the state of the project while relying on Git and GitHub for consistency and durable storage.


## **Workload Context**

Context should be provided which includes the type of CNF, workload, and CNF component (eg. Pod, container, Operator) this best practice applies to. The context, of an individual best practice, should illustrate the specific type of workload most likely to take advantage of the benefits listed. When applicable, it should also provide a warning if the practice would be a determent to a divergent type of workload.


## **Test Plan**

This CCDP will not be tested by the CNF Test Suite.


## **Scoring**
CCDPs may have different priorities and importance leading to different scores. Passing and failing scores may be different for similar reasons. Some may be mandatory.


## **Implementation History**

The first version of this template was created before KubeCon NA 2020.
